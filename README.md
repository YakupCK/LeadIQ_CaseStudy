# LeadIQ_CaseStudy
The task is about automation of "LeadIQ" Chrome extension
I used Java, Selenium Cucumber BDD Framework with Page Object Model
And I used "Sikuli" library to launch the browser
The task was not fully completed though, 
for example, launching the extension in headless mode is missing
